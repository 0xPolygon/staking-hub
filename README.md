This template repo is a quick and easy way to get started with a new Solidity project. It comes with a number of features that are useful for developing and deploying smart contracts. Such as:

- Pre-commit hooks for formatting, auto generated documentation, and more
- Various libraries with useful contracts (OpenZeppelin, Solady) and libraries (Deployment log generation, storage checks, deployer templates)

- Test contracts: `forge test`

If you intend to develop on this repo, follow the steps outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#install).

## Deployment

This repo utilizes versioned deployments. For more information on how to use forge scripts within the repo, check [here](CONTRIBUTING.md#deployment).

Smart contracts are deployed or upgraded using the following command:

```shell
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url <rpc_url> --verify
```

## Docs

The documentation and architecture diagrams for the contracts within this repo can be found [here](docs/).
Detailed documentation generated from the NatSpec documentation of the contracts can be found [here](docs/autogen/src/src/).
When exploring the contracts within this repository, it is recommended to start with the interfaces first and then move on to the implementation as outlined [here](CONTRIBUTING.md#natspec--comments)
